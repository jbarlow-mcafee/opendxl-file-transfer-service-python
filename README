File Transfer DXL Python service
================================

Overview
--------

The File Transfer DXL Python service provides the ability to store files
via the
`Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) fabric. OpenDXL brokers are configured by default to limit the maximum
size of a message to 1 MB. The File Transfer DXL Python service allows the
contents of a file to be transferred in segments small enough to fit into a DXL
message. This service could be used for infrequently transferring larger file
payloads while keeping the broker's maximum message size configured at a
reasonable value for typical application workloads.
